     * @brief Caches draw calls to be quickly reused without re-computing them.
     * 
     * When submitting geometry to be rendered, magma internally tries to optimize vertex cache usage.
     * This can be costly, since indices may be in any arbitrary order. This is why GL tries to cache
     * draw calls by recording them into rspq blocks, so this work doesn't need to be repeated.
     * Since the RSP commands only depend on the indices and not on vertex data (except matrix indices, see below),
     * the cached draw calls can be reused if for example the same indices are used every frame.
     * This only works if the indices are stored in a VBO (Just like with vertex data, see #gl_array_object_t),
     * which is why this cache is placed in this struct.
     * 
     * This field is initially NULL. The cache is only created and initialized when this VBO is used as the source for 
     * index data for the first time. For this to happen, it needs to be bound to #GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER_ARB while
     * #glDrawElements is called (see the exception below).
     * 
     * If #GL_MATRIX_PALETTE_ARB is enabled (skinning), the RSP commands are additionally dependent on matrix indices.
     * In that case, the draw call cache inside \ref gl_array_object_t.draw_call_cache is used instead.
     * 
     * This cache is invalidated whenever the data inside this VBO is modified.
